            George: Care for a smoke, sir?

            Edmund: No, thank you, I’m… (he lights his own pipe)

            George: Private?

            Baldrick: (taking cigarette from George) Oh, thank you, sir.
            (begins to eat the cigarette)

            George: Oh, dash and blast all this hanging about, sir! I’m as bored as
            a pacifist pistol. When are we going to see some action?

            Edmund: Well, George, I strongly suspect that your long wait for certain death is nearly at an end. Surely you must have noticed something in the air…

            George: Well, yes, of course, but I thought that was Private Baldrick.

            Edmund: Unless I’m very much mistaken, soon we will at last be making the final Big Push — that one we’ve been so looking forward to all these years.

            George: Well, hurrah with highly polished brass knobs on! About time!

            (phone rings within Baldrick’s backpack, Edmund answers it)

            Edmund: Hello; the Somme Public Baths — no running, shouting, or piddling in the shallow end. Ah, Captain Darling. Tomorrow at dawn. Oh, excellent.  See you later, then. Bye. (hangs up) Gentlemen, our long wait is nearly at an end. Tomorrow morning, General Insanity Melchett invites you to a mass slaughter. We’re going over the top.

            George: Well, huzzah and hurrah! God Save the King, Rule Britannia,
            and Boo Sucks the Hairy Hun!

            Edmund: Or, to put it more precisely: you’re going over the top; I’m getting out of here. (goes inside dugout)

            George: (follows Edmund in) Oh, now, come on, Cap! It may be a bit risky (tries to speak in a rousing Cockney dialect, but fails miserably),
            but it sure is bloomin’ell worth it, gov’nor!

            Edmund: How could it possibly be worth it? We’ve been sitting here since Christmas 1914, during which millions of men have died, and we’ve advanced no further than an asthmatic ant with some heavy shopping.
